# A fun discord bot that gives you health tips

## This runs on Discord's chat app so to use you'll have to setup a server and add the bot

To use here are some instructions you can use

  This pings the bot

    $hello 
    
This queries a public bodybuilding api that will share some choice quotes to get you going. Yeah Buddy!!
  
    $inspire 
    
  
Use any of the following words in a sentence with the bot in your discord chat
>["tired", "weak", "injured", "sleepy", "lethargic", "slow", "no energy", "overweight"] 

The bot will respond with a list of modalities for you to try. Each modality has items you can try that are saved in the database. 

Find out more a modality by typing,

    $list exercise 

Add some items to a modality by,

    $new exercise <an exercise you want to add>

To delete an exercise from the list,

    $del exercise <number> 
    
  where number is the index of the item in the list. Use the $list command to find that out
